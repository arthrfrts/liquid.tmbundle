# Liquid tmBundle

A [TextMate][textmate] _(and [Sublime Text][sublime])_ bundle for [Liquid][liquid].
Derived from the [PHP-Twig.tmbundle](upstream) project.

## Installation

TextMate, and most editors that support TextMate bundles, allow the installation
of bundles simply by extracting an archive or cloning the repository into the
application's bundle directory. This bundle is no different. Below is a list of
common bundle directories.

### Sublime Text

To install this bundle in Sublime Text, a few extra steps are required.

1. Clone this repository
2. Zip up the content of the repository's directory as `Liquid.zip` and rename it to `Liquid.sublime-package`.
3. Open Sublime Text 3 and in the menu, go to: `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
4. Navigate to `../Installed Packages` and copy the `Liquid.sublime-package` to this destination.
5. Restart Sublime Text.
